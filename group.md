## Reading list

### Xiong's recommendations

### Niu's recommendations

Robust mechanism design

- Carroll on linear contracts

- Bergemann-Brooks-Morris (BBM) agenda on auctions: BBM (2017, ecma), BBM (2019, aer)

- Survey by Carroll: https://web.stanford.edu/~gdc/survey.pdf

E(P) > E(Q) is equivalent to P+X first-order dominates Q+X for some r.v. X.

- Pomatto, Strack, and Tamuz. [arxiv. 1807.06927.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06927) 
It is somewhat surprising that a fundamental result like this was not proved until the 1960s.

How should a monopolist sell multiple goods to a single buyer?

- Daskalakis, Deckelbaum, and Tzamos (2017, ecma) [arxiv. 1409.4150.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4150)

- Daskalakis's work on [mechansim design via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01958) is also worth reading.   

New social choice papers that give constructive suggestions rather than impossibility theorems.

- Brandl, Brandt, and Seedig on consistent probabilistic social choice.

- Strategyproof Choice of Social Acts（Eric Bahel and Yves Sprumont, forthcoming at AER）

- I am not familiar with the "applications of mechanism design to social choice." 
It might not be a bad idea to learn some works in that field.
